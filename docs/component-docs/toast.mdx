# Toast

The Toast component is a molecule in the AliveUI component library. It provides a way to show brief, non-intrusive notifications to the user, displayed as a small popup at the edge of the screen.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useToast } from "@aliveui/ui";

export function ToastDemo() {
  const { toast } = useToast();

  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => {
        toast({
          title: "Scheduled: Catch up",
          description: "Friday, February 10, 2023 at 5:57 PM",
        });
      }}
    >
      Show Toast
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Setup

To use toasts in your application, you need to add the `Toaster` component to your application. This component is responsible for rendering toasts.

```tsx
// In your layout component
import { Toaster } from "@aliveui/ui";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head />
      <body>
        {children}
        <Toaster />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

The Toast component is built on top of Radix UI's Toast primitive, ensuring excellent accessibility:

- Screen reader announcements for toast appearances
- Automatically dismisses after a configurable duration
- Can be dismissed manually
- Keyboard accessible
- ARIA attributes are automatically managed

## Implementation Details

The Toast component is built using Radix UI's Toast primitive and Tailwind CSS for styling. It provides a flexible way to show non-intrusive notifications to users.

Key features:

- Multiple toast types (default, destructive)
- Customizable content
- Action buttons
- Automatic and manual dismissal
- Screen-reader friendly
- Swipe to dismiss on touch devices

The implementation uses a context-based approach with a toast manager that handles the creation, updating, and dismissal of toasts. This creates a centralized system that can be accessed from anywhere in your application.
